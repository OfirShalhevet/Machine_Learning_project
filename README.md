# Data Analysis Project

## Project Objective
In this data science project, I applied large-scale data processing techniques to classify candidate suitability for specific positions. The objective was to build a binary classification model that categorizes candidates as suitable (1) or unsuitable (0) based on a structured dataset with known and anonymous features. This project aimed to gain insights from large datasets and build predictive models to support decision-making processes.
